# ALPLA
ALPLA - The CNC milling machine built with a 3D printer and just a cordless screwdriver 

## üß† Idea

- Build a CNC milling machine using only two power tools:
  - A 3D printer (for plastic parts and templates)
  - A cordless drill (for all mechanical drilling)
- Apply the principle of bootstrapping:  
  Build a milling machine *without* access to a milling machine ‚Äî using tools that are widely available
- Avoid the need for professional machinery (e.g., lathe, mill, laser cutter)
- Make the project replicable with minimal equipment
- Keep the project low-cost and accessible to hobbyists
- Some explaining videos (Hint: turn on subtitles to get an English translation)

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- The machine must be rigid enough to mill stainless steel using a small-diameter end mill
- All drilling and mechanical assembly should be possible manually, yet precisely
- The machine dimensions should be easily scalable without redesigning the core system
- Use only commonly available parts:
  - Standard screws and profiles from hardware stores
  - No special-length fasteners or exotic components
- Support a modular build approach and allow for future upgrades
- Format: at least 1000x1000mm
- Precission: better than 5/100mm

## üß© Concept

- Use cast aluminum tooling plate (precision-machined on both sides) and stock parts
- Rely on the factory precision of aluminum stock for dimensional accuracy
- Design smart connections that take advantage of flat and straight surfaces
- Reduce the need for precise post-processing
- Use 3D printed tools and jigs for drilling and positioning
- Modular frame design allows for scalability and modifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

- Structural components are drilled using printed templates and the cordless drill
- 3D printed parts used for:
  - Alignment aids
  - Fixtures and spacers
- Standard mechanical components (screws, nuts, linear rails, ball screws, stepper motors)
- Adjustable components enable fine-tuning of geometry after assembly
